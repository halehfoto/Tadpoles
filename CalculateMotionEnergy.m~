%this is a  program to calculate the motion energy in a petri dish full of
%tadpoles. it first defines regions of interest. This will generate a
%circle that the user has to place on each well. In each region of interest
%then it will calculate the change in the image by first calculating the
%difference in two consecutive frames and then calculating the standard
%deviation of that image and provides one number as the output.
